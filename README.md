# Roguelike: Labyrinth
Simple roguelike dungeon exploration game. Current features are 
maze navigation and forward progression through endoless levels.

## Level design
Levels are all generated using Prim's algorithm. A maze style I find aesthecically appealing and a good balance between fun and challanging to navigate through.

Prim's algorithm is quite easy to conceptually understand and an elegant method of creating mazes. There are plenty of examples online to assist with understanding how it may be executed in code but none that I found that render the final maze with walls that possess thickness - A typical feature of roguelike game maps rendered with ascii graphics.

## Further Development

### The initial goals of this project

+ Practice Python and coding in general
+ Attempt to implement Prim's algorithm
+ Create a basic navigable roguelike game

### Further potential features:

+ Map display based on field-of-view
+ Path finding using A* and Dijkstra algorithms
